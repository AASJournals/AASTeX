## AASTeX52
The extant style files and documentation for authoring AAS Journal articles in LaTeX (circa 1999-2004).

## Community Feedback
We are soliciting feedback from the astronomy community in advance of a new version of AASTeX. The goals of this new version include: addressing a decade of technological change in LaTeX, supporting authors who now write manuscripts for a 100% digital journal, and supporting new directions in authoring from the AAS Journals [Futures Task Force recommendations](http://journals.aas.org/taskforce.html). Possible topics include but are not limited to:

- document layout (e.g., [emulateapj](http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~alexey/emulateapj/) support);
- tables including: deluxetable improvements, sharable table formats;
- graphics including:  includegraphics, figure layout and grids, videos;
- [bibtex](http://ads.harvard.edu/pubs/bibtex/) and/or [biblatex](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex?lang=en) and/or custom reference implmenetations or similar requests;
- URL linking that works;
- [CJK Font](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CJK_fonts) support;
- bugs or especially irritating biting insect type annoyances;
